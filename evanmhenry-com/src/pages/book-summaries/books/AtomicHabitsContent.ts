# The surprising power of atomic habits

- Improving your habits will make a large impact on your life
- Changing habits is hard for two reasons
    1. We try to change the wrong thing
    2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way
- Three layers of behavior change
    - Outcomes — goals
    - Processes — habits
    - Identity — self image
- Identity based habit change is the most effective
    - Non-identity based — "No thanks, I don't smoke anymore."
    - Identity based — "No thanks, I'm not a smoker."
- It is hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past behavior
- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity the more likely you are to maintain the habits associated with it
- You will maintain a habit if you make it a part of your identity
- What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe yourself to be
- The more you repeat a behavior the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior
- Your goal is to win majority of the time — perfection is unnecessary to make long term changes.
- Decide who you want to be:
    - What do you want to stand for?
    - What are your principles and values?
    - Who do you wish to become?
- Work backwards from the results you want to the type of person who gets those results
- Whenever you are faced with decisions throughout the day, think of how that person would act

# How to build better habits in 4 simple steps

1. cue — triggers your brain to initiate a behavior
2. craving — motivational force behind every habit
3. response — habit you perform
4. reward — end goal of every habit

- Behaviors followed by good consequences tend to be repeated
- Undisciplined people tend to be the people with the least amount of personal freedoms in life; aka lack of discipline leads to less opportunities
- Building habits in the present allows you to do more of what you want in the future
- What you crave is not the habit itself but the change it delivers

# The man who didn't look right

- You don't need to be aware of a cue for a habit to begin
- Before trying to build new habits, learn what your current ones are
- Habit Scorecard
    - Make a list of all daily habits (good or bad)
    - Mark your habits based on how they will benefit you in the long run
    - Good habits: +
    - Bad habits: -
    - Neutral habits: =
- Lack of awareness is the biggest problem in trying to change your habits
- Point Calling — saying the action you are about to take out loud
    - Hearing habits out loud makes their consequences seem more real

# The best way to start a new habit

- Common cues — time and location
- Implementation intention — "When situation X arises I will perform action Y"
- Being clear on what you want to accomplish leads to a better chance of accomplishing it
- Being specific about what you want to do with your time helps you say no to things that derail your progress
- We say yes to things because we don't know what actions we are giving up by saying yes
- Diderot Effect — buying something new leads to a spiral of more purchase
- You often decided what you are going to do next based on what you just finished doing
- Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior
- Habit stacking — doing habits you want to build back to back
    - Increases the likelihood that you'll stick with the habits

# Motivation is overrated; environment often matters more

- Your environment shapes your behavior
- Visual cues are the best catalyst for your behavior
- Remove destructive cues and replace with productive ones
- Creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a desired habit
- If you put triggers in your environment you are more likely to think about your habit
- Create separate spaces for work, study, entertainment, and cooking

# The secret to self control

- Creating a disciplined environment will help you become more disciplined
- If you don't manage cues you are allowing yourself to be tempted to do the behavior you are trying to avoid
- You can break habits, but you can pick them back up easily
- The best way to a reduce bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it
- Self control is a short term strategy

# How to make a habit irresistible

- Anticipation of a reward is what gets us to take action
- Temptation bundling — link actions you want to do with actions you need to do

# The role of family and friends in shaping your habits

- We imitate the habits of 3 main groups
    - The close
    - The many
    - The powerful
- Join a group where your desired behavior is the normal behavior
- New habits seem more achievable when you see others doing them every day
- Your culture sets your expectation for what is normal
- Surround yourself with people who have the habits you want to have
- Changing your habits when the change desired is not popular with your friends and family is tough
- Changing your habits when the change desired is popular is easy

# How to find and fix the causes of your bad habits

- Every action, good or bad, is motivated by a drive to change how you feel in that moment
- To make tough habits easier; associate them with a positive experience
- You don't 'have to' you 'get to'
- You switch from seeing these behaviors as burdens and instead see them as opportunities
- Living below your current means increase your future means
- Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem more unattractive
- Create a motivation ritual — do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit

# Walk slowly, but never backward

- It is easy to focus on creating the optimal plan — focusing on the best possible approach prevents us from taking action
- Action vs motion
    - Action — doing the behavior that will give you results
    - Motion — planning, strategizing, and learning
- Most people are in motion instead of taking action
- We do this because motion allows us to feel like we are making progress without the risk of failure
- When preparation becomes a form of procrastination, you need to change something
- The best way to build a new habit is to get your reps in

# The law of least effort

- Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life; reduce it
- When you remove things that take away from your time and energy you can be more efficient with your time
- Either automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible
- Reset everything you use
    - When you are done making dinner clean it up completely
    - When you leave your room leave nothing out of place
- By doing this, you are priming yourself for when you return to this place next

# How to stop procrastinating by using the two minute rule

- Habits shape the actions you take after them
- We are limited by where our habits lead us
- This is why decisive moments matter so much
- Most people try to make too many changes too quickly and then they fall off
- The Two Minute Rule — when you begin a new habit, it should take no more than 2 minutes to complete
    - The goal is to make your habits as easy as possible to start
- A new habit should not feel like a challenge
- You want to build a 'gateway habit' that leads to other good choices
- Master the habit of showing up
- A habit needs to be established before it can be improved
- Instead of trying to create the perfect habit, do an easy first part of it on a consistent basis
- Ritualize the beginning of any habit you want to build
- When trying to build a new habit the goal is to stay below the point where it feels like work

# How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

- Commitment devices enable you to lock in good intentions and not allow yourself to fall into temptation
- It is a choice that locks in a future behavior
- Automate as much of the mundane in your life as possible

# The cardinal rule of behavior change

- The costs of your good habits are in the present; the costs of your bad habits are in the future
- What is immediately rewarded is repeated; what is immediately punished is avoided
- Get better at delaying gratification
- Success in any field requires this skill

# How to stick with good habits every day

- 'Don't break the chain'
- Maintain your habit momentum by being consistent
- This makes it easier to keep a habit going
- Track all of the habits you want to build
- #1 rule — never miss 2 days in a row
- Missing a day doesn't ruin your progress
- Repeatedly missing days back to back ruins your progress

# How an accountability partner can change everything

- If failure is painful, it gets fixed
- If failure is painless, it gets ignored
- The more immediate and costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it
- Knowing that someone is watching is a powerful motivator
- You are less likely to procrastinate or give up if someone is watching your actions

# The truth about talent (when genes matter and when they don't)

- Choose the right field of competition to maximize your success
- The people at the top of any field are not only well trained, they are well suited for the task
- If you want to be one of the greats at anything, you have to pick the right thing to focus on
- Genes do not determine destiny, they determine areas of opportunity
- Find areas that excite you and match your natural skills
- Align your ambition with your abilities
- By combining your skills, you eliminate competitors
- Even if you aren't naturally gifted, you can be the best in a very narrow category
- Once you know your strengths, you can filter opportunities to better focus your time and energy on the things that you will be best at

# The Goldilocks Rule: how to stay motivated in life and work

- When starting a habit it is important to keep the action as easy as possible
- Once the habit is established, it is important to make continuous small improvements to it
- You can better maintain your motivation by working just where it is challenging and causes growth but it isn't too difficult
- If you only do the work when it's convenient, you won't get the results you want
- The top tier of people do what they need to do even when they don't want to

# The downside of creating good habits

- When you know routine movements / behaviors well it opens up mental space for more challenging things
- When you build habits, you begin to overlook to little things (errors) that you might make
- Create a system for reflection and review so you can make sure you aren't overlooking errors in the habits you have already established
- Reflection and review enables the long term improvements of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement

# Conclusion

- "He who has a why to live can bear almost any how."
- Suffering drives progress
- Your actions reveal how badly you want something
- Reward is on the other side of sacrifice
- Self control is difficult because it isn't satisfying
