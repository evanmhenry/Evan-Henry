# The Essentialist
- value proposition of Essentialism → once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, can you make your highest contribution to the things that really matter
- Essentialism — the relentless pursuit of less, but better
- constantly ask — "Am I investing my time in the right activities?"
- getting a lot done < getting the right things done
- make the wisest possible investments with your time and energy in order to operate at your highest point of contribution
- Essentialism is a disciplined, systematic approach for determining where our highest contribution lies, then making execution of those things almost effortless
- “If you don't prioritize your life, someone else will.”
- the more choices you are forced to make, the more the quality of your decisions deteriorates
- **Essentialist Steps**
    - explore — figure out the options you have and which are most important
    - eliminate — eliminate everything else
    - execute — remove obstacles and make execution easy
- become clear on what you want to accomplish in your lifetime; realize you can't do it all

# CHOOSE: The Invincible Power of Choice
- “If you could do only one thing with your life right now, what would you do?”
- you don't always have control over your options, but you have control over your choices
- I have to → I choose to

# DISCERN: The Unimportance of Practically Everything
- almost everything is non-essential
- distinguish the vital few from the trivial many

# TRADE-OFF: Which Problem Do I Want?
- saying yes to one opportunity inherently says no to several others
- you can either make the hard choices for yourself or allow others to dictate your choices

# ESCAPE: The Perks of Being Unavailable
- it is critical to set aside personal time to think — set aside distraction-free time to do nothing other than think
- in order to properly focus, you need to escape

# LOOK: See What Really Matters
- clarify what is most important and what you are trying to do in life
- most things don't matter; find the important stuff and only focus on that

# PLAY: Embrace the Wisdom of Your Inner Child
- imagination is the source of all human achievement
- 'play' is essential to creativity and spontaneity
- play helps broaden the range of options available to us
    - challenges old assumptions
    - helps reduce stress

## SLEEP: Protect the Asset
- the best asset you have for making positive contributions to the world is yourself
- if you underinvest in yourself (physically, mentally, spiritually, etc) you reduce the contributions you can make
- sleep is for high performers
- sleep breeds creativity
- sleep should be a priority
- sleep enables high levels of mental contribution

# SELECT: The Power of Extreme Criteria
- **the key to decision making: if you feel a complete and total conviction to do something say yes; otherwise it's a no**
- as you evaluate an option you have, think about what the single most important criterion is for that decision and give that option a score from 0 to 100
- if below 90 it should reject it; this will help avoid indecision
- use narrow and explicit criteria for decision making; aim for exactly what you want
- “If it isn't a clear yes, it's a no.”
- **Selective Criteria Process**
    1. Write down (in detail) the opportunity being offered.
    2. What are your minimum criteria for this option to be considered? — option has to pass all minimum criteria
    3. What are the 3 ideal criteria for this option? — option has to pass 2 of 3 ideal criteria

# CLARIFY: One Decision That Makes a Thousand
- eliminate any activities that do not align with what you are trying to achieve
- motivation and cooperation deteriorate when there is a lack of purpose
- individuals and teams thrive on clarity
- lack of clarity causes neglect of essential activities
- **Essential Intent** — a meaningful and measurable 'goal' that is extremely clear
    - “If I had to do only one thing, what would it be?”
    - answers “How will I know when I have succeeded?”

# DARE: The Power of a Graceful 'No’
- by being clear about your intent and goals, you will be able to say no to opportunities that don't align with either
- only say yes to the most important things that align with what you are trying to accomplish
- separate the person from the request → denying someone's request isn't the same as denying them as a person
- you can't be liked by everyone
- say no gracefully and deal with short term social consequences
- respect is more valuable than popularity
- **Ways to Say ‘No’ Gracefully**
    - temporary pause
    - pause for a few seconds before answering
    - 'no, but...'
    - state you don't have time currently, but would like to say yes at a future time
    - 'yes, what should I deprioritize' (*when dealing with a superior asking to add to your work)
    - remind superiors what you would have to neglect in order to complete their request

# UNCOMMIT: Win Big by Cutting Your Losses
- **Sunk Cost Bias** — tendency to continue investing time, money, or energy into something you know is a losing proposition
- be comfortable cutting losses
- **Endowment Effect** — tendency to undervalue things that aren't yours and overvalue things you already own
- “If I didn't own this item, how much would I pay to own it?”
- “If I didn't have this opportunity, how much would I be willing to sacrifice to obtain it?”
- take note of your current commitments and the impact they have; if they don't move the needle or help others, consider cutting ties or scale back your efforts and use that time for more important tasks

# EDIT: The Invisible Art
- use deliberate subtraction of activities so you can more deeply commit to the important ones
- having fewer options makes decisions easier on the brain
- use the essential intent discussed previously to edit the activities and behaviors you have in your life

# LIMIT: The Freedom of Setting Boundaries
- boundaries are fragile — once you let one fall, the rest of them fall
- boundaries protect your time from being hijacked by unnecessary things
- set boundaries in advance so you don't agree to things in the moment and then regret your decision
- be clear with others what is off limits
- make a list of dealbreakers; requests that you will deny unless they entirely align with your intent

# BUFFER: The Unfair Advantage
- most people assume best case scenario
- they underestimate the amount of work requried to get something done
- look ahead, plan, and prepare for different contingencies
- build in a buffer for unexpected events
- use the good times to create a buffer for the bad
- a good rule of thumb → add a 50% buffer to any time estimates you make
- **5 Risk Management Questions**
    1. What risks do you face on this project?
    2. What is the worst case scenario?
    3. What would the social effects of this be?
    4. What would the financial impacts of this be?
    5. How can you invest to reduce risks or strengthen financial or social resilience?

# SUBTRACT: Bring Forth More by Removing Obstacles
- What obstacles are keeping you back from achieving what you want to achieve?
- remove as many obstacles as you can
- **How to Remove Obstacles**
    - be clear about essential intent
    - identify obstacles slowing you down
    - remove them

# PROGRESS: The Power of Small Wins
- small wins in essential areas > big wins in non essential areas
- the most effective form of motivation → progress
- primary motivators for people
    1. achievement
    2. recognition for achievement
- make progress in meaningful work → you will stay motivated
- start small and build momentum, then ride momentum forward
- **'minimum viable progress'** — spend 10 minutes invested in a project / assignment significantly before the due date
- visualize your progress with graphs, images, etc

# FLOW: The Genius of Routine
- design routines that preserves what is essential
- routine
    - enables difficult things to become easier
    - helps free mental space and gives you more mental power to focus on other tasks
- nearly 40% of our choices are made unconsciously
- **focus on the most difficult task of the day first**
- start routines small and slowly build onto them

# FOCUS: What's Important Now?
- focus on the most important thing currently
- constantly ask yourself “What is the most important task in this moment?”
- “In work, do what you enjoy. In family life, be completely present.”

# BE: The Essentialist Life
- every choice you make to pursue only the essential builds on itself
