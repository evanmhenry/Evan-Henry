# Introduction
- The only meaningful measure for a leader is whether the team succeeds or fails
- Every leader and every team will fail at some point and must confront that failure
- For a leader, the humility to admit and own mistakes and develop a plan to overcome them is essential to success
- The best leaders are not driven by ego or personal agendas
- Leaders must own everything in their world; there is no one else to blame but themselves

# Extreme Ownership
- All responsibility for success and failure rests with the leader
- If an individual on a team is not performing well, it is the leader's responsibility to train and mentor the under performer
    - If consistently underperforming, the leader must make the call to find someone who can get the job done
- Total responsibility for failure is a difficult thing to accept
- When the team wins, the leader puts the spotlight on their team and not themself
- Say "here to help the situation" instead of "here to help you"
    - This change in wording helps people lower their defenses and accept your help
- By accepting the blame, a leader gains respect from those under them and encourages similar ownership

# No bad teams, only bad leaders
- It's not what you preach, but what you tolerate
    - When setting expectations, no matter what has been written, if you accept substandard performance, that becomes the new standard
- Leaders must enforce standards
- Leaders must ensure that tasks are repeated until the higher standard is achieved
- Leaders should never be satisfied
- Leaders identify weakness and seek to strengthen them
- Don't be a victim
    - If you are dealt a difficult situation, complaining about it does not justify poor performance

# Believe
- If a plan is not believed in by the leader, the people under the leader will not believe in it either
- When a leader's confidence breaks, those who are supposed to follow them see this and begin to question their own belief in the task at hand
- If a leader is given a project or mission and they don't understand it, they must ask why
    - If they can't answer the why on their own, they must ask superiors to explain
    - Finding this 'why' strengthens the belief in what is being done and leads to better overall performance
- The leader must not only explain what to do, but why it should be done

# Check the ego
- Everyone has an ego
- Ego drives the most successful people
- When ego clouds judgement and prevents you from seeing the world as it is, then it becomes destructive
- To implement extreme ownership, you have to check your ego and operate with a high level of humility
- When confronting someone about a problem, take ownership of the problem
    - By doing this you don't allow the persons ego to cloud their judgement / response to the situation

# Cover and move
- People in a team must all work together if a team is going to succeed
- When the team succeeds, everyone in the team succeeds
- Make the weak links a part of your team instead of the excuse for it

# Simple
- Simplify everything as much as possible
- When things go wrong, complexity compounds issues
- Ensure the lowest common denominator on the team understands the goal / plan perfectly

# Prioritize and execute
- It is impossible to tackle multiple issues at once
- Remain calm, prioritize the most pressing issue, and then get to work
- Countless problems will compound into a snowball effect and hurt you a ton
- "Relax, look around, make a call."
- An effective strategy is to stay roughly 1 to 2 steps ahead of real time problems
- To implement prioritize and execute into a team a leader must:
    - Evaluate the highest priority problem
    - Acknowledge in the simplest and clearest terms what the highest priority is
    - Develop a solution for this priority
    - Direct the execution of that solution
    - Move to the next highest priority
    - Maintain the ability to see other problems arising and be able to rapidly shift priorities if necessary

# Decentralized command
- Human beings are not able to manage more than 6 to 10 people
- Teams must be broken down into manageable groups of 4 to 5 people
    - Each team leader must know the why of the project / goal
    - Each team leader must fully understand the laid out plan to accomplish the goal / complete the project
    - Junior leaders must understand every decision they can and can't make
    - These leaders aren't working 100% on their own accord
- To effectively practice decentralized command plans and goals needs to be as simple as possible so that communication errors are minimized

# Plan
- The leaders intent is the most important part of a plan
    - When this intent is understood by the entire team, it helps guide decision making
- Leaders must delegate the planning process down to team members and junior leaders
    - Teams participation is critical to success in execution
    - Giving team members ownership over the plan gives them buy-in, belief, and a better understanding of the plan
    - This translates to more effective execution
- Senior leaders must be careful to not get caught up in minute details of a plan
    - By staying about the little details, the leader is able to ensure the overall plans direction is correct
- Leaders must prioritize the information being presented and explain it simply and clearly to avoid information overload in their team
- The test for a successful plan brief is this: Does everyone in the team understand the whole plan?
- There will always be some risk to a plan / mission
    - Leaders must focus on minimizing risks that can be controlled and plan for contingencies of uncontrollable risks
- Those who don't risk can't win

# Leading up and down the chain of command
- It is paramount to success that senior leaders explain to the junior leaders and workers executing a plan how their role contributes to the bigger picture
- Leadership isn't just for people in junior and senior leadership roles
- Anyone on a team can practice leadership skills when working in their job
- If your boss isn't giving you clarity of a project or plan, don't blame them
- Blame yourself and find a way to get clarity of information by asking the right questions
- A public display of discontent or disagreement with any leader undermines the authority of all leaders in an organization
- Take responsibility for leading everyone in your world (subordinates and superiors)
- If someone isn't doing what you want or need them to do, look at your own actions and determine what you can do better to enable this
- Don't ask you leader what you should do, tell them what you plan to do
- Don't view speaking to leaders as a you vs them: they want you to succeed

# Decisiveness amid uncertainty
- Leaders cannot be paralyzed by fear
- This results in inaction
- It is critical for leaders to act decisively amid uncertainty
- Make the best decision you can with the immediately available information
- Waiting for the 100% right and certain solution leads to delay and indecision which impedes execution
- Be proactive not reactive

# Discipline equals freedom
- Discipline starts every day when your alarm goes off
    - It is the first test of the day
    - Do you get immediately out of bed and begin your day or do you let yourself fall back asleep
    - Get out of bed = win
    - Fall back asleep = fail
- Though this may seem like a small and insignificant thing: failing this test translates into failure of more important decisions
- If you want extra time to work on things, you have to make it
    - Wake up earlier
    - Go to bed later
    - Maximize small moments during the day where you aren't getting work done
- Disciplined people and teams win
- Being disciplined leads to freedom
- A true leader is not intimidated by someone else taking charge
    - A leader who lacks confidence is
- A leader must be aggressive but not overbearing
- A leader must be calm but not robotic
    - leaders who lose their temper also lose respect
    - If a leader never shows any emotion they come off as a robot
- A leader must be confident but not cocky Leaders must be competitive but also be gracious losers
    - Respect all opponents good or bad
- Leaders must be detailed oriented but not obsess over them
- Leaders must be humble but not passive; quiet but not silent
- Leaders must be close with those on a team but not too close
- Leaders must practice extreme ownership over everything in their world
- A good leader doesn't gloat in their position
